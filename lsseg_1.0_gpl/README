This is the GPL version 1.0 of the Level-Set Segmentation Library.

If you have Doxygen installed, you can generate an introduction to LSSEG and 
code documentation by typing 'doxygen' at the command prompt.

COMPILING INSTRUCTIONS:

In order to compile LSSEG, you need the CImg library (http://cimg.sourceforge.net/).
This library is all implemented in a header file which you should copy to the
LSSEG include/ directory or otherwise include in your project.
The version of CImg for which this software was adapted is 1.17.
CImg is mainly used in LSSEG for image visualization and reading/writing of images
to file.  All code which depend on CImg is declared/implemented in the 
files 'cimg_dependent.h' and 'cimg_dependent.C'.

You will also need the 'boost' library (www.boost.org).

COMPILING FOR LINUX USERS:

The provided Makefile has only been prepared for the linux platform.  
There is no configuration script, so you might have to manually edit the Makefile 
in order to make it work.  

To make the library, type 'make' or 'make lib' at the command prompt.  (The library
file will be saved in the 'lib' directory).

To make one of the sample programs,type 'make app/*****', where ***** is the name of the
example program.

COMPILING FOR VISUAL STUDIO USERS:

You will have to establish your own project, using the include files from the include/ 
directory and the source files from the source/ directory in order to compile the
library.

If you want to compile a sample program, add its source file (found in the app/ directory)
to your project.  This is the file containing the main() function.

You will have to link with ImageMagick (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) and
PthreadsWin32 (http://sources.redhat.com/pthreads-win32/) in order to make it work.
